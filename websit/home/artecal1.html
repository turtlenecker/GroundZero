      Addiction is one of this society's worst problems. It can ruin lives and families. It is one of the most atrocious things that can happen to anyone. I would just like to make something clear before we start, not all addictions are bad, but, for this artical I will be talking about the most detrimental of cases and topics. For example, gambling, addiction to electronics, smoking, vaping, and drugs. 
      </p>

Gambling is becoming more and more addictive as companies are finding faster and better ways to get you addicted. I have personally seen gambling ruin relationships. I have also seen money be thrown away in a single game. But the problem is they don't stop at just one loss or just one win. They will continue to throw money away until they have no money left. I remember hearing on tv that there were even times when people would put their cars and houses on the tables just to play one more game. And these are the goals of the casinos to empty your pockets dry. Now going to the casino isn't bad as long as you gamble in moderation and you are prepared to lose a couple of bucks. But <em> I can not overstate this enough be careful! </em>

<p class="p1">  Being addicted to electronics, this addiction plagues most of the youth today. With most apps like tik tok, Instagram, and Snapchat. Most of my friends spend more than 4 to 6 hours on average a day. Some astonishing feats but there are even worse chases one time I spend a full weekend watching Netflix. But this doesn't just plague youth, it also happens to older people. There are also many several side effects to using social media in general. For example: body aches, carpal tunnel syndrome, insomnia, vision problems and weight gain or loss are just a few of the physical problems that can result from an internet addiction. emotional effects can include depression, dishonesty, anxiety, social isolation, aggression and mood swings.. About a year ago my grandmother broke up with someone who would use his phone for more than 11 - 18 hours a day. He would not talk to my grandmother or engage with anyone else most of the time. It was unfortunate to see him go but now my grandmother is happier than ever it seems. This addiction can also be super detrimental to someone's life.<em> Just in general please be careful about these things.</em>

      <p class="p1">        Smoking and vaping can destroy your lungs very easily and it is super easy to get addicted to it.
This paragraph will be split into two parts: the first one will be talking about smoking and the second one will be talking about vaping. Smoking has negative effects on your health and other people around you. I have heard it can be very addictive for some people and it can cause an “average of $1.4 million” per person, said drugfree.org. Vaping has even worse effects on the body. Vaping was supposed to be a better alternative to smoking but it ended up being even more addictive and even worse for your body. <em>Overall vaping and smoking are very addictive and in the long term,</em> it is really bad for you.

  Drugs are probably the most detrimental addiction you can have. It can destroy your health, your mental stability, and that are so many other side effects to using drugs. Nowadays drugs are getting even more and more deadly. I heard it is like a craving like no other. It is an almost unbreakable addiction. Even after you go to rehab the insatiable craving is still there you will never be able to shake that craving. And eventually, it will overtake you and you will go back to doing drugs. Someone that I know very dearly was clean of drugs for 2 years. But suddenly that craving overtook her. She was in a tent at the park. We were alerted to it by the police. We tried to help her but she was too far gone. And we have never seen her since that day. To add inslate to injury there was a couple that was growing drugs in their houses. And if all that wasn't enough there was a gang that shot someone at the top of the road at ross road. “ A 19-year-old Abbotsford man has died following a shooting that occurred this afternoon in the area of Ross and Simpson roads in west Abbotsford.
  Abbotsford Police Sgt. Judy Bird said reports of shots fired came in at around 3:30 p.m., and police who arrived at the scene found an injured man. He was transported to hospital by air ambulance but died shortly afterward. Officers with the Abbotsford Police major crime unit, patrol division, gang crime unit, and forensic identification unit remain on scene Monday night as they collect evidence and speak to witnesses, Bird said. The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) will now be leading the investigation. No further details have been released at this time, including the identity of the victim. The shooting took place near Ross Road Elementary, but schools in the district were closed for the day to commemorate Remembrance Day.” said the Abbotsford news. https://www.abbynews.com/news/person-airlifted-after-report-of-shots-fired-in-abbotsford/
  In the end, these incidents were all connected to drugs.
